# storyboards

Storyboards are an exciting feature first introduced in iOS 5 that save time building user interfaces for your apps. Storyboards allow you to prototype and design multiple view controller views within one file.

In this app I build a sample app to create a list of players and show you the games they play and their skill rating. In the process, youâ€™ll learn common tasks which can be accomplished using in storyboards.

Also, I'll 'cover segues, static table view cells, the Add Player scene, game picker scene and refactor  storyboards.
